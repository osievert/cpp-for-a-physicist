# Extras

From a conversation about several modern c++ concepts. Touches on:
- brace initialization (preferred in modern code)
- rule of zero / three / five (rule of zero is preferred when you can)
- performant ways to create data and return it from a function (return by value)
- passing heavyweight object to functions (prefer references when you can)
- smart pointers (use them when you can't use a reference)
- generic programming (with templates)
